These included various college sites, Drupal modules and\n        standardized aspects of ASU sites such as the ASU Global Header.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>\n      <h3>ASU Request for Information</h3>\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          The first project I was given ownership of was the ASU RFI module,\n          which was supposed to be a plug & play solution for new college sites\n          to set up a \"Request for Information\" form on any page of their Drupal\n          site so that prospective students could get additional information on\n          college degrees.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This project required me to work with various organizations across the\n          university including the Marketing Hub, EOSS & Ops to deliver a\n          product that would assist in onboarding new students.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>ASU Global Header & Footer</h3>\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          In order to be Web Standards compliant, every site must include the\n          ASU Global Header & Footer at the top and bottom of every web page\n          respectively.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The footer is a straightforward piece of HTML that houses ASU's\n          Innovation badge along with various links to important information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The header includes important links just like the footer, however it\n          also houses an ASU Search bar (powered by Google) that allows users to\n          search for information both at the site being viewed or across all\n          college sites simultaneously.It also acts as an integral part for\n          various systems that need to be deployed across all university sites.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For example, it is an important piece in the University's Single\n          Sign-on solution which allows students to maintain their authenticated\n          status when browsing through various University sites back-to-back.\n          SSO greatly improves the user experience and deploying it through the\n          header has proven to be an extremely effective solution.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Header is also an important piece in the University's analytics\n          solution. It acts as a vector to deploy ASU's Google Tag Manager code,\n          so the Marketing Hub can collect important information on what drives\n          engagement with ASU's web presence as well as how to best interact\n          with users.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <h3>Site Building</h3>\n\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          There are hundreds of organizations across the University and only a\n          few of them have employees that are familiar with sitebuilding.
